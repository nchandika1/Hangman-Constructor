# Hangman-Constructor

Hangman is a game where the user tries to guess the word

This version of the "Hangman" game uses the following features:

* Javascript Constructors
* Inquirer Node package
* Asynchronous/Callback Functions
* Recursion

Modularity could be achieved further in the inquirere callback functions

In order to show the flow in a simple manner and since this code is not big enough, the nester callback functions have been used to implement this program

There are mainly two Objects used in this game:
 
- Word :  Represents the word to be guessed in the game
- Letter :  Represents each letter of the word to be guessed
